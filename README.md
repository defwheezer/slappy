Circuit Documentation
Summary
This circuit integrates a variety of components including microcontrollers, sensors, displays, and switches to form a complex electronic system. The primary microcontrollers in use are the ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi 3B, which are likely to be the main computational and control units. The circuit also includes PIR sensors for motion detection, TFT LCD displays for visual output, an audio level meter for audio signal processing, and a servo motor for actuation. Power management is handled by USB-C connectors and XY MOS modules, and user interaction is facilitated through toggle switches and a push switch. Visual feedback is provided by an array of LEDs with current-limiting resistors.
